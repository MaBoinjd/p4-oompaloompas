## Ideation
We came up with our idea by putting any idea we had onto our scrum board. After a while, we figured out that we wanted to do a photo gallery to host a bunch of pictures that we had. Our home page shows our design come to life; we have a distinct color scheme and a rectangle in the middle that will showcase our pictures.
